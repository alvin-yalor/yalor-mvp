# Scibids & DV360 Integration Report

## Overview of Scibids
Scibids provides artificial intelligence (AI) solutions designed to optimize programmatic advertising. Their core offering revolves around AI-powered automated bidding strategies that aim to maximize return on ad spend (ROAS) and align media investments with specific, measurable business goals. They specialize in dynamic bidding strategies that adapt to advertiser-specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) through the use of both first-party and third-party data.

In late 2023, Scibids was acquired by DoubleVerify, resulting in an integration of Scibids' real-time AI capabilities with DoubleVerify's robust measurement, media quality, and analytics data.

## Understanding Native DV360 Custom Bidding
Before detailing the integration, it is helpful to understand DV360's native "Custom Bidding" feature. Custom Bidding is an advanced, outcome-based bidding feature that allows advertisers to define custom logic for valuing ad impressions, moving beyond standard automated bidding strategies.

### How it works natively:
1.  **Define Objectives and Signals**: Advertisers identify a Key Performance Indicator (KPI), such as customer lifetime value, specific revenue, or brand lift, along with proxy signals that predict success (e.g., Floodlight events, Google Analytics 4 goals, or impression signals).
2.  **Create Custom Algorithms**: Advertisers write a custom bidding script (often Python or JavaScript, with a maximum size of 7MB) or use predefined rules. This logic uses the provided signals to assign a monetary value or score to each ad impression based on its likelihood to drive the defined KPI. 
3.  **Machine Learning Phase**: Once activated, the algorithm enters a learning phase where Google's machine learning evaluates over 40 distinct signals over several days to understand the algorithm's scoring criteria.
4.  **Real-Time Optimization**: When the algorithm is assigned to a campaign, insertion order, or line item, it predicts the value of each available impression in real-time at the auction level, dynamically adjusting bids to maximize the delivery of high-value impressions.

## Integration with Google Display & Video 360 (DV360)
Scibids operates as the first formal "Custom Bidding" partner for Google's DV360 demand-side platform (DSP). This integration allows advertisers to push Scibids' custom AI models directly into the DV360 platform, replacing standard bidding algorithms with highly tailored decisioning logic.

### How It Works:
1.  **Custom Algorithm Generation**: Advertisers configure their goals within the Scibids platform. Scibids AI generates custom bidding algorithms (often as Python or JavaScript models) that dictate how much should be bid for specific impressions based on predictive models.
2.  **DV360 Custom Bidding**: These models are fed into DV360 via its "Custom Bidding" feature. DV360 executes these custom rules in real-time during programmatic auctions.
3.  **Real-Time Impression Valuation**: For every available impression, the Scibids model evaluates real-time signals from DV360, combining them with advertiser-provided data (e.g., precise conversion tracking, custom tracking, attention metrics, or DoubleVerify quality data). The model calculates the expected value of the impression and sets the optimal bid price accordingly.
4.  **Full-Funnel Optimization**: The AI optimizes across the entire marketing funnel, from upper-funnel efforts like Connected TV (CTV) to lower-funnel direct response mechanisms.

## Key Benefits
*   **Precision and Control**: Moving beyond generalized bidding algorithms, advertisers have precise control over impression valuation methodologies.
*   **Performance Improvements**: By customizing bidding logic to focus precisely on granular signals, campaigns frequently see significant improvements in customized KPIs, leading to enhanced ROAS.
*   **Operational Efficiency**: Advertisers can manage billing and accept platform terms directly within DV360, streamlining the vendor management process.
*   **Enhanced by DoubleVerify**: Post-acquisition, the integration incorporates impression-level media quality metrics directly into the bidding algorithm, allowing the AI to bid more aggressively on high-quality ad placements and dynamically avoid sub-optimal inventory.

## Conclusion
The Scibids integration with DV360 represents a shift towards customizable, AI-driven programmatic buying. By empowering advertisers to bring their own logic—generated by Scibids—into the DV360 DSP, brands and agencies can more effectively tailor their ad spend to exact business outcomes rather than proxy metrics.
